# docker-experience-builder
Create a Docker image for ESRI ArcGIS Experience Builder

I honestly can't tell what the license requirements are on Experience Builder
so I am assuming it needs to be locked down and not trying to include a downloader
in this project for now.

You will need to download the zip yourself and put it in this folder.
Go to https://earlyadopter.esri.com/home.html and sign in and then 
click through until you find Experience Builder and download it.

As of today they are at Beta2. 2020-01-24
